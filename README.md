# Beepy Config

A configurator for your [Beepy](https://beepy.sqfmi.com) device.

## Usage

Run the configurator with:

```shell
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nwithan8/beepy-config/master/beepy-config | sudo bash
```

This will require you to have `curl` and `bash` installed on your system, and needs root privileges to run.
